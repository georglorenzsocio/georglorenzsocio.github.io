## Overview

Education shapes life chances far beyond formal qualifications. It influences social relationships, integration, political participation, health, and social cohesion. My research is situated at the intersection of sociology and educational science and addresses how social inequalities and patterns of cohesion emerge, persist, or change within school contexts.

Across my work, I combine theory-driven research with advanced quantitative methods, longitudinal data, social network analysis, and computational approaches. My overarching goal is to identify social mechanisms that shape inequality, integration, and cohesion during adolescence—a life stage in which social structures are both highly consequential and still malleable.

My research agenda is organised around five interrelated areas.

## 1. Subtle Discrimination in Schools
A first core strand of my research examines how subtle and often unintended forms of discrimination arise in everyday school interactions. My doctoral work demonstrated how teacher stereotypes can translate into biased expectations and self-fulfilling prophecies, thereby reinforcing ethnic and social inequalities in educational outcomes. Using longitudinal data, I showed that even small expectation biases can accumulate over time and contribute to persistent achievement gaps.

Subsequent research extended this work to new dimensions of inequality, including language use, accents, gender, and socioeconomic background. Across these studies, a central finding is that discrimination in schools is rarely overt but emerges through routine judgments and interactions that systematically disadvantage certain groups. My current and future work in this area focuses on intersectional patterns of disadvantage and on synthesizing existing evidence through meta-analytic approaches, with the aim of clarifying when, how, and for whom teacher expectations contribute most strongly to inequality.

## 2. Peer Networks, Social Capital, and Educational Inequality
A second research focus explains how social capital and peer influence contribute to social and ethnic disparities in educational outcomes. My work shows that unequal access to social capital is driven largely by neighbourhood and school segregation, including for recently arrived refugee adolescents, whose integration is stronger in more diverse school contexts. At the same time, network processes can partly offset disadvantage—for example, when minority students select academically successful peers as friends. I also use actor-based simulations and longitudinal network models to examine when peer influence amplifies inequality, including evidence that social contagion can differ between friendships among students of similar versus dissimilar social backgrounds. Going forward, I extend this work from within-school segregation to between-school segregation, linking peer processes more explicitly to school choice, neighbourhood inequality, and institutional differentiation.

## 3. Institutional change
A third line of work analyses how educational institutions structure opportunity. I contribute to debates on ability tracking by reassessing prominent claims about its effects and by studying whether and when differentiation improves outcomes or reinforces inequality. I also examine institutional reforms and their unintended consequences, including evidence that recent structural reforms have not reduced ethnic segregation between schools. A further institutional focus is the expansion of all-day schooling, where I study how longer shared school time affects social integration, intergroup relations, and social inequality. This research programme integrates policy-relevant questions with mechanism-focused theory and careful empirical tests.

## 4. Social integration and intergroup relations in diverse school contexts
My work on intergroup relations advances theory on why friendship segregation emerges—or fails to emerge—in adolescent networks. Joint work on segregation theory argues that intergroup relationships in adolescence are shaped less by strong homophily preferences and more by opportunity structures created by classroom composition. Related projects develop a multidimensional perspective on classroom diversity and theorise how heterogeneity affects peer relations and teaching quality. This agenda aims to identify the contextual conditions under which diversity supports positive peer relations and cohesive learning environments, rather than fragmenting them.

## 5. Social cohesion, polarisation, and digital life in adolescence
Social cohesion is increasingly threatened by polarisation, and many foundations of these processes are laid in adolescence. Building on my work on networks, diversity, and school contexts, I develop a programme on how cohesion among young people can be conceptualised and measured, how school composition shapes cohesion, and how school practices influence cooperation and attachment. Two practices are particularly central: adolescents’ social media use and opportunities for democratic participation within schools. This agenda also addresses inequality in access to cohesive learning environments, with a focus on social and ethnic background.
