title: About me
---

I am an Assistant Professor the Department of Sociology at Utrecht University.

I obtained my PhD in social sciences ('summa cum laude') in 2017 from the University of Bamberg, Germany. Afterwards, I held positions as project coordinator (Humboldt-University of Berlin), project leader (Leipzig University), and research group leader (University of Potsdam). 

My research agenda addresses educational inequality, social cohesion in diverse school environments, and the dynamics of adolescent social networks. I pursue an explicitly interdisciplinary approach that integrates sociology with psychology, educational science, and computational social science. My work has introduced and advanced theory on ethnic discrimination and social segregation in schools and their role in producing educational inequality, shaping both academic debates and public discourse. Methodologically, I develop and apply innovative combinations of large-scale survey design, longitudinal network analysis, simulations, and mixed-methods approaches to generate novel empirical insights into relational processes in educational settings.

Below is a list of my publications and work in progress. You can find more detailed information on my research projects here and read about my professional and teaching activities here. You can also find my up-to-date CV here, and visit my Google Scholar profile.
