I am Assistant Professor at the Department of Sociology at Utrecht University (the Netherlands).

I obtained my PhD in social sciences ('summa cum laude') in 2017 from the University of Bamberg, Germany. Afterwards, I held positions as project coordinator (Humboldt-University of Berlin), project leader (Leipzig University), and research group leader (University of Potsdam). 

My research agenda addresses 1) educational inequality, 2) social cohesion in diverse societies, and the dynamics of social networks. I pursue an explicitly interdisciplinary approach that integrates sociology with psychology, educational science, and computational social science. My work has introduced and advanced theory on ethnic discrimination and social segregation in schools and their role in producing educational inequality, shaping both academic debates and public discourse. Methodologically, I develop and apply innovative combinations of large-scale survey design, longitudinal network analysis, simulations, and mixed-methods approaches to generate novel empirical insights into relational processes in educational settings.
