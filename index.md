title: About me
---

I am an Assistant Professor the Department of Sociology at Utrecht University.

He obtained my PhD in social sciences ('summa cum laude') in 2017 from the University of Bamberg, Germany. Afterwards, I held positions as project coordinator (Humboldt-University of Berlin), project leader (Leipzig University), and research group leader (University of Potsdam). 

My research agenda focuses on educational inequality, social cohesion in diverse school environments, and the dynamics of adolescent social networks. My work takes an interdisciplinary approach, integrating sociology with psychology, educational science, and computational social science. I have advanced theory on ethnic discrimination and social segregation in schools and their influences on educational inequality, and this work has shaped both academic debates and public discourse. Methodologically, I combine large-scale survey design, longitudinal network analysis, simulations, and mixed-methods approaches to gain novel empirical insights on relational processes in schools.

Below is a list of my publications and work in progress. You can find more detailed information on my research projects here and read about my professional and teaching activities here. You can also find my up-to-date CV here, and visit my Google Scholar profile.
